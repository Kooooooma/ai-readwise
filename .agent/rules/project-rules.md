# Project Rules

This rule file loads the shared project configuration from `AGENTS.md`.

The `AGENTS.md` file contains all the project-specific rules including:
- Tech stack requirements (TypeScript/React for frontend, Python 3 for backend)
- Python virtual environment setup (venv)
- Code style guidelines for Python and TypeScript
- File organization structure
- General development guidelines

**Note**: All actual rules are maintained in the `AGENTS.md` file to ensure consistency across multiple AI code agents (Cursor, Antigravity, Copilot, etc.).
